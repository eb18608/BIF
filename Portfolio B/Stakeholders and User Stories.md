# Stakeholders
## Workshop Attendees
These are the people who attend the workshops. They are likely to be students from secondary schools and colleges. They can be split into three types of student:
- The **apathetic student.** This student is only attending the workshop out of obligation. They are likely to be part of a school group and would not otherwise have chosen to be there. Primarily, they are in the workshop because they wish to play with and use the drones. They do not necessarily have any interest in STEM and aren’t likely to have much knowledge in the field. This is likely to be due to a lack of exposure to the field, and any chances that they may have had before having not engaged them.
- The **curious student.** This student has more of a general interest in both their education and their schooling. They may possibly already have an interest in STEM fields and could have some basic insight into what the workshop could entail. They have chosen to attend this workshop in order to gain experience and as an opportunity to gain more knowledge in these STEM areas. This student will be interested in more than just having fun flying drones and will hopefully be receptive to the research information that the workshop provides.
- The **driven student.** This student is likely to be exceedingly interested in STEM fields and already have a fair bit of background knowledge in the subject. They are also likely to already be considering their future prospects and what they would like to do in life. Out of these three defined types of students, the driven students are the ones that would be most enthusiastic in attending the workshop. They wish to prepare themselves and to get an insight into what their higher education could resemble (specifically with regards to a possible future in STEM). Like with the curious student, the driven student will also wish to expand their knowledge in the subjects covered in the workshop.
## Workshop Ambassadors
The people who run the workshop and guide the students through the activities. This includes our clients, and the other people that they have enlisted to assist in the running of the workshops. There are two main groups of workshop ambassadors:
- **PhD students who run the workshop (our clients).** Our clients are incredibly passionate about their work and their research. They are proud of what they have researched and wish to share it with other people through the medium of their outreach workshops. They wish to get the attendees excited and engaged in the subject of bio-inspired flight, and through this they look to inspire further engagement into the fields of STEM. They also strive to make sure that their workshop is entertaining and informative (in terms of data from their research) at the same time.
- **The other ambassadors who run the workshop.** These people are helping out with the workshops and making sure that the activities run smoothly for the students to take part in. With more relation to the app which we are creating, these ambassadors may be the ones helping to install it onto the students’ phones. They may also teach them how to use the app and play the game.
## Project Team
These are the people who are involved in the project but are unlikely to use the product once it is complete. There are three different groups here as well:
- **Project Managers.** Daniel Schien and Simon Lock are managing this project. They are here to assist us and to evaluate both our product and our performance at the end of the academic year.
- **Project Mentor.** Our mentor is also here to assist us, and to be a readily available contact if we have any issues or need any advice.
- **Project Developers.** We are the project developers. We will be making the design decisions and producing the product.

# User Stories
## Workshop Attendees:
- As an **apathetic student,** I want the game to be enjoyable to play, so that I can be focused on the gameplay and have a good time.
- As an **apathetic student,** I also want the game to be replayable,  in order to stay engaged and have it hold my attention for longer.
- As a **curious student,** I want the game to be engaging, informative and representative of real-world scenarios. I would like this so that I can further look into the subjects and be more informed.
- As a **driven student,** I would want the research information in the app to be easy to get to and to understand so that I can use it to inform my decisions in pursuing a career in STEM.
- As a **driven student,** I would also want the game to be engaging so that I can still enjoy the larger part of the app as well.
## Workshop Ambassadors:
- As a **client,** I want the game to be fun to play so that the workshop attendees stay engaged in our research in bio-inspired flight. I also want the gameplay to be realistic enough so that it portrays real-world scenarios and doesn’t serve to misinform the people playing the game.
- As a **client,** I also want the game to remind the users of our workshops. This is so that they will be encouraged to stay focused on the subject even after the workshops have finished.
- As an **ambassador,** I want the game to be easy to explain to the students so that I do not have to spend too long trying to help the students get to grips with it. This is because I may have to help many students with only a limited amount of time.
- As an **ambassador,** I also do not want the game to overshadow the workshop as the outreach program is meant to demonstrate the research that has been completed and I would want the game to reinforce the workshop experience, not retract from it.
- As an **ambassador,** I finally want the students to be engaged with the game without too much hassle, so that the students are not put off from the app, either from it being too difficult to set up, or from having too steep of a learning curve.
## Project Team:
- As a **project manager,** I want the product to be a success so that the clients are satisfied with the result of our course and so that the project developers receive a good grade that reflects the effort they have made.
- As a **project mentor,** I want the app to be made following proper developmental procedures so that the students I am mentoring are successful in their course and are able to create a good product for their clients.
- As a **project developer,** I want the product to be well made so that it reflects my abilities in app development and more broadly in software product engineering. 
- As a **project developer,** I also want the scope of the product to be reasonable so that I do not feel stressed or overwhelmed with my workload throughout the duration of this course.
