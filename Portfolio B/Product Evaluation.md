# Product Evaluation
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic that is currently affecting us all, we were unable to work with any of the end users of our product. In an effort to still get some feedback on our design choices and the overall app which we have developed, we opted to instead trial our app with our siblings that are of a similar age and demographic to the intended users. However, this understandably yielded a much smaller amount of feedback than we would have liked. We decided that the best approach for this evaluation was through observation. We also asked for any extra comments which they may have had. These can be seen in the table below.

| Comment(s) | Possible solutions | Solvable |
|:---------------|:-----------|:----------:|
|"Turning is too sensitive."<br>"It is hard to hover in place."|The slider to control both rotations and height could be made larger, so that more precision can be gained when it is in use. This will allow for slower turning speeds to be used, and should make it easier to find the correct position to hover the drone.|Yes|
|"The loops turn red too fast."<br>"The loops are too far apart, they don't show up on the minimap until you are close."<br>"The timer ran out too fast."|These are level design issues that we can solve by simply changing the level files.|Yes|
|"I keep getting stuck on the building, I want to slide across the walls instead."|This is a much harder issue to solve as it would require changing a large part of how our physics engine calcuates collisions.|Not without large changes|
