# Product Evaluation
Throughout the development of our product, we made sure to evaluate the decisions which we were making. We made sure to get feedback from our clients so that we knew our design choices were on track. These key meetings coincided with our three submission deadlines:

## Minimum Viable Product
People involved: clients, mentor, us.
Tested through observation in meetings (as this was in person with us all, we documented the feedback by directly assigning Jira tasks based on what was discussed) and tested iteratively ourselves while developing.
MVP involved a lot of fast-paced development, as it is the backbone of the app, so often...?
Controls; changed slightly with requests from clients.
Initial physics engine, speeds and camera angles.
Mock buildings for size comparison.
Basic UI

## Beta Release
Tested again through observation.
People involved: clients, us, other students.
These tests were often performed while we were programming, so we sometimes didn't document as we just implemented the changes directly. (We often worked as a group, or at least with pair programming, so rarely needed to convey this information outside of face-to-face communication)
Here we couldn't test with users because the workshops are infrequent and didn't line up.
Tested outside of the workshop demographic to get a broader sense of feedback. It's gonna go on the play store so anyone can use it.
Advanced physics engine with collisions.
Extra game mechanics, loops.
Menu system extended, achievements and settings

## Final Release
Observation, recorded feedback from users. Asked for feedback to be based on two separate parts: the visuals and the gameplay.
This was documented (see sample material) and we used it to make some improvements. 
Other improvements were not made due to time constraints found as a result of the lockdown, but we will make these changes in the summer. (This might not be needed here, as extra notes contain repetition.)
People involved: us, two close-to-users, wanted more users but covid.
New buildings
More game mechanics, fuel pickups, letter collection, air streams.
Final physics engine with new speeds
Customisation
Levels
