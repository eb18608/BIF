# Extra Notes
Due to many factors, including the Covid-19 pandemic, we were unable to completely finish the game to a standard which we are happy with. Due to this, we have offered to continue development in the summer in order to polish and complete the app for our clients. As a result, we will be able to solve many of the issues that have been raised in our product evaluation. Furthermore, we hope to get more feedback from our clients (and potentially more intended end users) in order to make sure that the end result is completed correctly. Finally, the summer work won't need to meet the constraints put in place by the project's mark scheme. This means that we won't need to write it in Java and so we are considering porting the game to Unity. We feel that this will allow the final product to be more polished and therefore a better game for our clients to receive.

This instruction manual was designed to be printed off and used as part of our clients' outreach workshop. With this in mind, we chose a bold, colourful design and made sure to keep the text to a minimum so that it can be read and understood easily from a distance.
